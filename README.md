Before installing, please make sure you prepare an environment with Python 3.10+, by running e.g.

```shell
# in case you have (Ana)conda; for venv etc., the shell command must be different
conda create -n bdbc "python==3.10"
```

>
> [!NOTE]
> In addition, in case you want to run atlas registration (i.e. DeepLabCut/Tensorflow),
> Please make sure you install CUDA Toolkit in accodance with
> [this version compatibility info](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations).
> 
> At the time of writing, DeepLabCut uses Tensorflow 2.0â€“2.12.
