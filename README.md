# bdbc-data-pipeline

A super-repository for managing a set of packages used for processing the BraiDyn-BC data files.

## Installation

First, clone the repository, and initialize it with submodules:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BraiDyn-BC/bdbc-data-pipeline.git
cd bdbc-data-pipeline
git submodule init && git submodule update  # clones the submodules

# within an appropriate (virtual) python environment
python install.py --help

# running `install.py` with particular
# installation targets will install
# the required libraries
```

If you intend to perform DeepLabCut-based atlas registration,
**we recommend installing DeepLabCut/Tensorflow first**, before
installation of the libraries in this repository.

In case you encounter issues building up a CUDA-aware environment,
please refer to [this document](./cuda-environment.md).


## Documentation

For a brief overview of the packages, please refer to the [docs](./docs) directory.

## Prerequisites

Before installing, please make sure you prepare an environment with Python 3.10+, by running e.g.

```shell
# in case you have (Ana)conda; for venv etc., the shell command must be different
conda create -n bdbc "python==3.10"
```

>
> [!NOTE]
> In addition, in case you want to run atlas registration (i.e. DeepLabCut/Tensorflow),
> Please make sure you install CUDA Toolkit in accodance with
> [this version compatibility info](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations).
> 
> At the time of writing, DeepLabCut uses Tensorflow 2.0â€“2.12.

## Installation

First, clone the repository along with its [submodules](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255):

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BraiDyn-BC/bdbc-data-pipeline.git
cd bdbc-data-pipeline
```

Then you can run `install.py`, e.g. as follows:

```shell
python install.py
```

By running the above command, the script attempts to install everything
in this repository (along with all the external dependencies).

For more detailed instructions about `install.py`, please refer to
[the documentation](./docs/README.md#how-to-use-the-installation-script).

The resulting package versions (in a python 3.10 environment) may be found
under the [requirements-python3.10](./requirements-python3.10) directory.
